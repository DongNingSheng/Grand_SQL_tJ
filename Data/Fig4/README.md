spin_bond_mid.dat: 1st col is the location of the site=(x-1)*Ly+y, 3rd are 4th cols are the nearest-neighbor spin bond orders along y and x respectively

SC_order.dat at different bond dimensions m are used for Fig. 4(a) and (b): 1st column is the site location=(x-1)*Ly+y, 3rd column is the y-bond pairing

pair_order_NN.dat in Data/Fig2/t00E50m12000 is used for Fig. 4(c)
