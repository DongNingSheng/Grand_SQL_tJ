pair_order_NN.dat saves nearest neighbor pairing order parameters: 1st column is the site location=(x-1)*Ly+y, 3rd column is the y-bond pairing, 4th column is the x-bond pairing

num_elec.dat saves the electron density: 1st col is the x coordinate, 2nd is the y coordinate, 3rd is the electron density
